## there are 3 folders, dev, test, and val.
#The dev dataset is for few-shot learning to prime the model, and the test set the source of evaluation questions.
#The auxiliary_training data could be used for fine-tuning, something important for models without few-shot capabilities. This auxiliary training data comes from other NLP multiple choice datasets such as MCTest (Richardson et al., 2013), RACE (Lai et al., 2017), ARC (Clark et al., 2018, 2016), and OBQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018).
#Unless otherwise specified, the questions are in reference to human knowledge as of January 1st, 2020.

## we also need to remove the A, B, C, D from the answers at the end
## we also need to remove the newline characters from the end of each line
## the answer is A, B, C, or D, so we need to convert that to an index in the array of answers
letter_to_index = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]


## keep the questions and answers in a list of dictionaries
